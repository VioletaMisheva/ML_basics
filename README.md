# ML_basics

This repository contains the implementation of some basic Machine learning algorithms. It was created for my facilitation of workshops. 

Contents:
- Unsupervised learning basic approaches
- Clustering (K-means and hierarchical)
- Very similar to it, a notebook with PCA and t-sne (with some extensions on the PCA)
- neural nets with keras 
- unsupervised learning example using ecommerce data set (topic modelling)
- NLP basics
